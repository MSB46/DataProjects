    "This is the part that gave me the most trouble. Unfortunately, the page layout of every movie while seemingly similar in layout, are not exactly 1:1 levels of consistent. For example, in most pages, the budget of a movie would be the first span element on the Box Office section of the page. However, some movie pages like [_An American Tail_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090633/?ref_=adv_li_tt) don't include the budget. This would mean using an element's class name or XPATH to find where the budget (and similar elements) can be done without a problem on some pages but would fail on others. As a temporary \"solution\" I decided to label any unknown budget as \"-1\" so I can make note of it in the data cleaning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some cases where something else is unexpectedly scrapped instead of the budget despite being there (there are some movies where I'm just given the U.S/Canada gross, for example). Due to the inconsistent layout of the pages, a \"one size fits all\" solution where I can perfectly parse the budget of each page isn't going to be in the cards at the moment. On the bright side, the latter effect could easily be fixed due to an observation of mine regarding how the data in the budget column is presented (perhaps you might notice it too). But let's worry about that in the data cleaning process. "
